              Earlier this year a new Royal Coat of Arms was created for accession of His Majesty The King. Civil Service logos, including UKHSA, feature the Royal Crest to show “His Majesty’s Government” is acting in his name.
              All UKHSA branded templates on Pulse have been updated to incorporate the new crest. This includes slide presentations, posters, standard document file, various Word files, email signature template and Teams backgrounds.
              All digital assets, including email signatures, should now use the new branding. Please delete old templates that you may have saved for convenience, and download the new versions from Pulse.
              For physical objects such as signage, conference banners, promotional materials, you only need to update these when the objects are due to be replaced or are damaged, so both versions of the logo may run in parallel for some time.
